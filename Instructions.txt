### Role:
You're a web application developer building a sleek, minimalist interface for managing e-books.

### Project Goal:
Create a responsive web application to manage and view an e-book collection.


### App Structure:
Your application should include:

1. E-Book Overview Page
 - Displays a grid or list of e-books
 - For each e-book, show:
    -- Cover Image (Image-URL-M)
    -- Title
    -- Author
    -- Year of Publication
 - Data is loaded dynamically from a PostgreSQL database.

2. E-Book Detail Page
 - When a book is clicked, show a detailed view with all the above information, plus Publisher and ISBN.

3. Print-Friendly Version
 - Create a version of the overview page optimized for printing.
 - Use a dedicated CSS file or media query for print styles.
### Technologies to Use:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: PHP, FastAPI
- Database: PostgreSQL

### Instructions:
The system will consist of two screens â€“ an overview of e-books and a detailed view of a selected e-book. For each e-book, at least the following information must be displayed: cover image (Image-URL-M), title, author, year of publication.

If you are unsure about anything ask me instead of making assumptions.

//
run tests to confirm the functionality of the code
the frontend test using Mocha
finally create a README file with instructions on how to run the application and a description of the project.
